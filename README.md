# movie_database_crud_api
Just some practicing with golang to make a movie database like api. This does not have an actual database but uses built-in data structures.
1. To use, take all the files and move them in a single directory.
2. Then move the directory you just created to your go installation directory, for example, for me, it was, 'C:\Program Files\Go'.
3. When in the Go installation directory, navigate to the 'src' directory and paste your created directory.
4. Open the directory in your terminal or command prompt as admin or sudo.
5. Run 'go run main.go'
6. Open your browser and navigate to 'localhost:8000/movies' to get the list of all movies.
7. To test out different operations, you need to use Get or Post methods by your preffered way.
